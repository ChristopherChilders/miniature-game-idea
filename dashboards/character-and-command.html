        Characters and Command
    </h1>
    <h3>Command Groups</h3>

    <h5>Champions</h5>
    <p>Same</p>

    <h5>Standard Bearers</h5>
    <p>Aos</p>

    <h5>Musicians</h5>
    <p>
        Same, except you don't have to test for swift reform. 
        If you have a musician in your unit, 
        then you can perform one swift reform before or after you move your unit.
    </p>

    <h3>Heroes</h3>
    <p>
        They are now Unit Upgrades in the same way as a Command Group.
        Think WarmaHordes.
    </p>

    <h3>Lords</h3>
    <p>
        Act as Independant Units like in AoS/40k, 
        except that they can be bought a Unit of Guardians.
    </p>

    <h3>Guardians</h3>
    <p>Act as Bodyguards for Lords.</p>

    <h3>Battle Standard Bearers</h3>
    <p>Same as End Times: Archaon.</p>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>Same</p>
